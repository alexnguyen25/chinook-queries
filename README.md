You can find the answers in the [Queries folder](./queries)

## Queries
Query 1: Create a new Table Music Video, that is a class of type Track (generalization) but adds the attribute Video director. A music video is a track. There cannot be a video without a track, and each track can have either no video or just one. 
Query 2: Write the queries that insert at least 10 videos, respecting the problem rules.
Query 3:  Insert another video for the track "Voodoo", assuming that you don't know the TrackId, so your insert query should specify the TrackId directly.
Tip: For a different database with People and Quotes, here is how to insert a Quote from the name of the Person

-- Inserts John in the Person table

INSERT INTO Persons(name) VALUES("John");

-- Inserts a new Quote for John

INSERT INTO Quote(person_id, quote)
    SELECT person_id, "It Worked 🎉"
    FROM Person
    WHERE name == "John";

Query 4:  Write a query that lists all the tracks that have a ' in the name (e.g. Jorge Da Capadócia, o Samba De Uma Nota Só (One Note Samba)) (this is á,é,í,ó,ú)
Query 5: Creative addition. Make an interesting query that uses a JOIN of at least two tables.
Query 6: Creative addition. Make an interesting query that uses a GROUP statement and at least two tables.
Bonus Points. The queries 7 to 8 are optional, if you complete them, you can get bonus points that can help your other grades

Query 7:  Write a query that lists all the customers that listen to longer-than-average tracks, excluding the tracks that are longer than 15 minutes. 
Query 8:  Write a query that lists all the tracks that are not in one of the top 5 genres with longer duration in the database.
